# The AI Project Lifecycle

<div class="result" markdown>

  ![Placeholder Image](../assets/images/placeholder.jpeg){ align="right" width="50%" }

   This section introduces our model of the AI project lifecycle, and provides detailed descriptions of the constitutive stages.

   The model we propose is focused on research and innovation because this allows us to embed ethical, social, and legal principles *within* the actual practices and processes that are (in part) responsible for the myriad social harms and benefits that have been identified by those working in data and AI ethics (broadly construed). Nevertheless, the conception of the project lifecycle that we propose is a socially situated one. This prevents our model from being myopically focused on research and innovation practices, to the neglect of other perspectives, such that vital sociopolitical contextual factors are overlooked or ignored.

   The following cards can be used to navigate to the relevant pages of this section.
