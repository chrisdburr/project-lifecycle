# From Principles to Practice

On this page we offer some illustrative examples that demonstrate how the [SAFE-D principles](safe-d-principles.md) and attributes can be used to support risk management and responsible research and innovation, by scaffolding the task of identifying specific actions or decisions that can be undertaken during the project lifecycle.

| Principle & Attribute | Action or Decision | Project Lifecycle Stage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Sustainability** (Robustness) | *The model used in our system has been internally and externally validated. The external validation has been carried out across several varied environments to ensure robustness of the system.* | Model Training, Testing and Validation |
| **Accountability** (Accessibility) | *All identified stakeholders were consulted prior to the development of our system to help critically evaluate our project plans and ensure they were intelligible.* | Project Planning and Problem Formulation |
| **Fairness** (Equality) | *Persons affected by use of the system have avenues of recourse, ability to contest system outputs and demand human intervention.* | System Use & Monitoring |
| **Explainability** (Responsible Model Selection) | *Features were hand-selected in conjunction with domain experts to optimise for both interpretability and predictive power.* | Preprocessing & Feature Engineering and Model Selection |
| **Data Quality** (Timeliness & Recency) | *Only data that were collected within the previous 3 months were used to ensure the training data were up-to-date.* | Data Extraction or Procurement |
