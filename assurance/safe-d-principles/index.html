<h1 id="the-safe-d-principles-operationalising-responsible-research-and-innovation">The SAFE-D Principles: Operationalising Responsible Research and Innovation<a class="headerlink" href="#the-safe-d-principles-operationalising-responsible-research-and-innovation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>The SAFE-D principles are normative principles that provide practical guardrails throughout the design, development, and deployment of data-driven technologies, such as ML models or AI systems.
The five principles are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sustainability</li>
<li>Accountability</li>
<li>Fairness</li>
<li>Explainability</li>
<li>Data (Quality, Integrity, and Protection and Privacy)</li>
</ul>
<p>The 'Data' principle is different from the first four, insofar as it is only indirectly linked to key ethical requirements—hence the separation from the other principles.
Nevertheless, its legal and regulatory scope is fundamentally connected to normative values, such as a) considerations of human rights (e.g., respect for privacy), b) methods of responsible data governance (e.g., reproducibility of methods), and c) core democratic values (e.g., decisional autonomy).
Therefore, it is appropriate to include alongside the more explicitly ethical principles.</p>
<p>Each principle serves as a starting point for a project team's reflective and deliberative activities.
Moreover, the principles also serve to enable a common evaluative framework, which can be used by both developers and regulators when communicating regulatory requirements (e.g., legal compliance, auditing, or co-development of best practices).</p>
<p>Each principle comprises a series of core attributes, which are designed to further specify the practice-based demands of the principles and also help identify specific actions or decisions that are likely to be required in a specific policy domain (e.g., healthcare, education, employment).</p>
<p>This page introduces and defines the five principles and their core attributes.
Following this introduction, the <a href="property-claims.md">following page</a> offers examples of actions that a project team could take at a specific stage in the project lifecycle to provide assurance that they have considered the regulatory and normative requirements of the principle.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Definition</p>
<p>Sustainability can mean a couple of things. From a technical perspective, sustainability requires the outputs of a project to be safe, secure, robust, and reliable. For example, if an organisation is developing an autonomous vehicle, it should operate safely in the intended context of use. However, in the context of responsible data science and AI, there is also a social sustainability component. This aspect of sustainability requires a project’s practices to be informed by ongoing consideration of the risk of exposing individuals to harms even after the system has been deployed and the project completed—a long-term (or sustainable) safety.</p>

<td>Safety</td>
<td>Safety is core to sustainability but goes beyond the mere operational safety of the system. It also includes an understanding of the long-term use context and impact of the system, and the resources needed to ensure the system continues to operate safely over time within its environment (i.e. is sustainable). For instance, safety may depend upon sufficient change monitoring processes that establish whether there has been any substantive drift in the underlying data distributions or social operating environment. Or, it could also involve engaging and involving users and stakeholders in the design and assessment of AI systems that could impact their human rights and fundamental freedoms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Security</td>
<td>Security encompasses the protection of several operational dimensions of an AI system when confronted with possible adversarial attack. A secure system is capable of maintaining the integrity of its constitutive information. This includes protecting its architecture from the unauthorised modification or damage of any of its component parts. A secure system also remains continuously functional and accessible to its authorised users and keeps confidential and private information secure even under hostile or adversarial conditions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Robustness</td>
<td>The objective of robustness can be thought of as the goal that an AI system functions reliably and accurately under harsh or uncertain conditions. These conditions may include adversarial intervention, implementer error, or skewed goal-execution by an automated learner (in reinforcement learning applications). The measure of robustness is, therefore, the strength of a system’s functional integrity and the soundness of its operation in response to difficult conditions, adversarial attacks, perturbations, data poisoning, or undesirable reinforcement learning behaviour.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reliability</td>
<td>The objective of reliability is that an AI system behaves exactly as its designers intended and anticipated. A reliable system adheres to the specifications it was programmed to carry out. Reliability is therefore a measure of consistency and can establish confidence in the safety of a system based upon the dependability with which it conforms to its intended functionality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Accuracy and Performance</td>
<td>The accuracy of a model is the proportion of examples for which it generates a correct output. This performance measure is also sometimes characterised conversely as an error rate or the fraction of cases for which the model produces an incorrect output. Specifying a reasonable performance level for the system may also require refining or exchanging the measure of accuracy. For instance, if certain errors are more significant or costly than others, a metric for total cost can be integrated into the model so that the cost of one class of errors can be weighed against that of another.</td>

<p>Accountability can refer to transparency of processes and associated outcomes that enable people to understand how a project was conducted (e.g., project documentation), or why a specific decision was reached. But it can also refer to broader processes of responsible project governance that seek to establish clear roles of responsibility where full transparency may be inappropriate (e.g., confidential projects).</p>

<p>Fairness is inseparably connected with legal conceptions of equality and justice, which may emphasize a variety of features such as non-discrimination, equitable outcomes, or procedural fairness through bias mitigation. However, these notions serve as a subset of broader normative considerations pertaining to social justice, socioeconomic capabilities, diversity and inclusivity. For this reason, the term ‘fairness’ can be confusing due to the wide variety of ways it is employed, and the large number of more specific concepts that fall within its scope.</p>

<td>Source Integrity and Measurement Accuracy</td>
<td>Effective bias mitigation begins at the very commencement of data extraction and collection processes. Both the sources and instruments of measurement may introduce discriminatory factors into a dataset. When incorporated as inputs in the training data, biased prior human decisions and judgments—such as prejudiced scoring, ranking, interview-data or evaluation—will become the ‘ground truth’ of the model and replicate the bias in the outputs of the system in order to secure discriminatory non-harm, as well as ensuring that the data sample has optimal source integrity. This involves securing or confirming that the data gathering processes involved suitable, reliable, and impartial sources of measurement and sound methods of collection.</td>

<tr>
<td>Timeliness and Recency</td>
<td>If datasets include outdated data then changes in the underlying data distribution may adversely affect the generalisability of the trained model. Provided these distributional drifts reflect changing social relationship or group dynamics, this loss of accuracy with regard to the actual characteristics of the underlying population may introduce bias into an AI system. In preventing discriminatory outcomes, timeliness and recency of all elements of the data that constitute the datasets must be scrutinised.</td>

<tr>
<td>Relevance, Appropriateness, and Domain Knowledge</td>
<td>The understanding and utilisation of the most appropriate sources and types of data are crucial for building a robust and unbiased AI system. Solid domain knowledge of the underlying population distribution and of the predictive or classificatory goal of the project is instrumental for choosing optimally relevant measurement inputs that contribute to the reasonable determination of the defined solution. Domain experts should collaborate closely with the technical team to assist in the determination of the optimally appropriate categories and sources of measurement.</td>

<p>Collectively, the above principles and corresponding list of core attributes may appear overly demanding.
However, they are not intended to represent a checklist, for which all projects must provide documentation to demonstrate that they have addressed each requirement.
Instead, the principles and attributes should be treated as deliberative prompts—a "reflect-list" rather than a checklist.
If, during initial scoping activities or project planning, and in conjunction with stakeholders, it is determined that certain attributes are irrelevant to the project for justifiable reasons, then no activities may be necessary.
An additional principle of proportionality, therefore, should be adopted as a <em>meta-principle</em> of sorts, helping direct project governance decisions.</p>
<p>But, if a goal and corresponding set of attributes are deemed important, then the next step is to consider what system or project properties need to be established, and what evidence must be gathered and documented to demonstrate that the top-level goal (and corresponding attributes) have been obtained.</p>
<p>The next page offers guidance on this, showing how the principles and activities are integrated into the model of the <a href="project-lifecycle.md">project lifecycle</a> already introduced.</p>
